        <p class="about-text">
            Durhamâ€™s own Double Shot Band - known for playing all the favorite
            classic rock covers from the Allman Brothers to ZZ Top. We play hits
            from the 70's, 80's and 90's. Scott Sublett pounds the drums and belts
            out the vocals. Mark Allman and Chip Hill play those favorite guitar
            licks you love to hear. And last but not least, Tim Blinsmon on the
            bass covers those bottom grooves. Put it all together and the
            experience is one that is not to be missed!! Scott hails from the
            great state of Georgia, but he has called Durham home for many years.
            Chip lives in Carrboro and Mark and Tim are good ol' local boys born
            and raised in Durham.
